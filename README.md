### NLP_Sentiment_Analysis_basic.ipynb
This notebook performs basic sentiment analysis, classifying text as either positive or negative. It uses a public dataset and an open-source transformer model from the Hugging Face library.

### NLP_Text_Generation_basic.ipynb
This notebook uses Robert Frost's poetry to generate machine-translated poetry. It utilizes a transformer model from the Hugging Face library.

### NLP_Article_Spinning_basic.ipynb
This notebook uses BBC text data for article spinning, a technique often associated with Black Hat SEO. It utilizes the open-source transformer model BERT from the Hugging Face library.

### NLP_Name_Entity_Recognition_basic.ipynb
This notebook uses open-source NER data to recognize entities such as persons, organizations, and locations. It utilizes a transformer model from the Hugging Face library.

### NLP_Text_Summarization_basic.ipynb
This notebook uses a transformer model from the Hugging Face library to summarize text.

### NLP_Question_Answering_basic.ipynb
This notebook uses a Hugging Face model for question answering within the given text.

### NLP_Zero_Shot_Classification_basic.ipynb
This notebook performs zero-shot classification on BBC data.

### NLP_Fine_Tuning_Sentiment_Analysis_intermediate.ipynb
This notebook uses the publicly available "GLUE SST-2" dataset from Hugging Face. It then employs the DistilBERT model from Hugging Face, fine-tuning it on custom data to perform sentiment analysis, classifying text as either positive or negative.

### NLP_Fine_Tuning_on_Custom_Data_intermediate.ipynb
This notebook performs sentiment analysis, classifying text as positive, negative, or neutral. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle, and the open-source DistilBERT transformer model from Hugging Face is used.

### NER_intermediate.ipynb
This notebook focuses on the Named Entity Recognition (NER) task using the publicly available "CoNLL2003" dataset. Given that there are 8 different tags, a slightly different approach is required. The DistilBERT cased model is used, as NER is a case-sensitive task.

### NLP_Translation_intermediate.ipynb
This notebook uses a publicly available dataset from Hugging Face to create a fine-tuned translator from English to French.
